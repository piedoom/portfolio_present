					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Started computers & design with 3D</li>
						<li>Began degree in New Media Design in 2014</li>
						<li>Fell in love with UI/UX</li>
						<li>Graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology in May 2018</li>
						<li>Now I'm interviewing with Linux Academy (yay!)</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						- I started getting really into digital design around 10-12 when I picked up the 3D platform "Blender" and started messing around with it<br><br>
						- That evolved into a variety of design disciplines ranging from app design concepts to motion graphics / youtube tutorials, and website design<br><br>
						-  In 2014 I started college & new media design, where I focused on UI/UX<br><br>
						- Just graduated in May<br><br>
						- Came across Linux Academy<br><br>

						<li>Scranton resident</li>
						<li>Games & Music</li>
						<li>Education background</li>
						<li>Love Animals</li>
						<li>Programmer & Linux User</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						- So in terms of who I am as a person,<br><br>
						- I was born and raised in Scranton, PA - a former coal-mining town that you may have heard of if you ever watched The Office<br><br>
						- I pass the time with music and computer games (and I've even tried to create some games)<br><br>
						- Both my parents are public school teachers, grew up in an environment that had a big focus on teaching.<br><br>
						- In college I started picking up programming & development along with Unix systems.   - In fact, later in college I had a part time job teaching basic coding skills to kids at a place called iCanCode Club<br><br>
						-  That's partly why I'm passionate about Linux Academy and their mission.  I love the idea of fusing my love of design with my love of technology and education.<br><br>

					<h2>Light Background</h2>
					<p>
						Musicians can add real instruments digitally through a process called "sampling".  Resamplr is an online marketplace for sampled instruments.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is a project I've been working on for over 4 years.  I'll lightly touch upon earlier instances but will focus mainly on final iterations and process work.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						So, before I get into more detail, here's a little bit of background on what Resamplr is and what technology it uses.<br><br>
						Resamplr is a webstore for sampled instruments.<br>Sampling is a process where a real-life instrument are digitized for use in a virtual studio.  (For instance, piano sounds in more recent songs are often sampled, digital pianos, instead of real-life pianos.) <br><br>
						Sampled instruments are being used more and more, with flagship audio companies like Native Instruments offering huge libraries for sometimes thousands of dollars.<br><br>
						As a musician myself, I've created several sampled instruments, and I wanted a way to publish them for others to use.<br><br>

						In terms of this presentation's scope, Resamplr has a ton of versions and process work, but today I'll just be highlighting more recent iterations and what I've learned.
					</aside>

				<!-- problem, solution -->
				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/headphones-bg.jpg" data-background-position="left" data-background-size="cover" class="compact">

					<div style="max-width: 400px;">
						<h2>The Problem</h2>
						<p>Companies that create digital instruments often implement poor & impersonal user experiences.</p>

						<h2>The Solution</h2>
						<p>Create a modern and approachable audio software company that puts users' needs<br> first.  Sales follow customer happiness.</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							I identified multiple problems with current solutions relating to both audio companies and web stores in general.<br><br>
							- Audio companies are still very proprietary, closed, and impersonal.  Their web presence is usually sterile and very corporate - which doesn't really mesh with music culture.<br><br>
							- I also sought to create this site because current solutions weren't specialized enough, and took too much profit.  One-off marketplace sites like Sellfy didn't allow for much branding work, and took as much as 20%.<br><br>
							----<br><br>
							- the solution was to create my own approachable audio software marketplace that had a focus on user-centric design.<br><br>
							- Additionally, by creating my own site I could integrate another payment processor and bring fees down to as little as 3%.<br><br>

					<h2>My Responsibilities</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>UI & UX</li>
						<li>Visual Design</li>
						<li>Creative Direction</li>
						<li>Development</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						My responsibilities for this project included UI/UX design, Visual & Creative direction, as well as web development.  I really wanted to see this project through as I'm very passionate about the topic, so I had to learn quite a few things in the process.

				<!-- User Journey -->
				<section>
					<div class="grid">
						<div class="col">
							<h2>User Journey</h2>
							<p>A digital commerce site isn't exactly groundbreaking territory - but it's easy to get things wrong.</p>
							<p>My goal is to create as little friction as possible and encourage the user to purchase items.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col">
							<img src="media/resamplr/user-flow.svg"/>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						I started by creating a user journey with a simple chart illustrating user navigation.<br><br>
						While a commerce site doesn't seem particularly exciting or groundbreaking, there are a lot of common pitfalls I see in other commerce sites.  <br><br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<!-- User Journey - Login -->
				<section>
					<div class="grid">
						<div class="col">
							<h2>User Journey - Login</h2>
							<p>User sign-in pages can be where many potential customers lose interest.</p><p>Let's have as little friction as possible.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col">
							<img src="media/resamplr/login-flow.svg"/>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						For instance, many sites will require a login before an item can be added to a user cart.  Asking a user to login creates unnecessary friction that may cause them to leave. <br><br>
						Instead, I designed the site to get users invested before requiring a login or credit card number.  Any user - logged in or not - can wishlist items.  That small time investment will encourage them to go the extra step to create an account or enter in payment information later.
						<br><br>
						On the product side of the user experience, I made sure to promote free resources and sound packs to encourage new users to register an account.

						Audio samples were especially important, so I created several variations before finding a layout that balanced visual design with information.  <br><br>
						I planned for the sound player to be persistent through page changes (similar to soundcloud) so the user could browse other products while listening to samples from another product.

					<h2>Issues & Improvements</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						I created this design for Resamplr in 2016.  However, I went back and reviewed my design in early 2018 as I learned a lot since my first iteration.<br><br>
						This next section will highlight the problems I found with my previous design, and what I did to resolve those issues.

						Additionally, while I may have written a summary of what Resamplr *is*, it's better to *show* what services it provides.  Supporting text is great, but for the most part users skip text and go straight to media and other content - but there was no product content on my home page!

					<h2>New Iterations</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						In early 2018, I reworked my previous design and focused on fixing the issues I mentioned above.

					<div style="overflow: scroll; max-height: 60vh;">
						<img src="media/resamplr/comps/home.png" style="width: 100%;"/>

					<aside class="notes">
						The new homepage shows users what Resamplr provides, instead of telling them with boring text.  Products are shown on the first page,
						along with a playable sample, description, and price.  The bottom of the page features an area where social content could be displayed from
						tutorials to giveaways.  <br><br>
						I used complementary colors as well as angles to make the page more exciting and dynamic and I drew inspiration from jazz-era posters and media.
					</aside>

				<section 
					data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/signup.png"

					<aside class="notes">
						The typography is still modern and thin, but much more legible.  A slightly thicker font combined with a dark-on-light theme greatly helps visibility.<br><br>

				<section 
					data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/product.png" 
					data-background-size="contain" >
					<aside class="notes">
						On to the product page - <br>
						I believe the biggest improvement was a smarter usage of color.  Purple was reserved for interactions and other high-importance sections.<br><br>
						The new one-column layout helped cut down on visual noise and better guide the user towards content and media.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section 
					data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/product2.png"

						I began with some general user personas.<br><br>
						User A wants to watch sports highlights on transportation.  They want bite-sized content and quick interactions.<br><br>
						User B just wants to relax watching highlights.  They want to sit back and watch anything and everything.<br><br>
						User C wants to catch up with the latest so they can talk about sports with their friends and colleagues.  They love specific sports teams and would like to know about them specifically.
