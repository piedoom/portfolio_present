					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Started computers & design with 3D</li>
						<li>Began degree in New Media Design in 2014</li>
						<li>Fell in love with UI/UX</li>
						<li>Graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology in May 2018</li>
						<li>Now I'm interviewing with Linux Academy (yay!)</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						- I started getting really into digital design around 10-12 when I picked up the 3D platform "Blender" and started messing
						around with it
						<br>
						<br> - That evolved into a variety of design disciplines ranging from app design concepts to motion graphics / youtube
						tutorials, and website design. I really loved publishing content to the web so I could share it with others.
						<br>
						<br> - In 2014 I started college & new media design, where I focused on UI/UX
						<br>
						<br> - Just graduated in May
						<br>
						<br> - Came across Linux Academy
						<br>

					<h2>More About Me</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Scranton resident</li>
						<li>Games & Music</li>
						<li>Education background</li>
						<li>Love Animals</li>
						<li>Programmer & Linux User</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						- So in terms of who I am as a person,
						<br>
						<br> - I was born and raised in Scranton, PA - a former coal-mining town that you may have heard of if you ever watched
						The Office
						<br>
						<br> - I pass the time with music and computer games like Halo and Rainbow Six Siege (and I've even tried to create some
						games)
						<br>
						<br> - Both my parents are public school teachers, grew up in an environment that had a big focus on teaching.
						<br>
						<br> - In college I started picking up programming & development on my own time along with getting my degree in design.
						- In fact, later in college I had a part time job teaching basic coding skills to kids at a place called iCanCode Club
						<br>
						<br> - That's why I'm passionate about Linux Academy and their mission. I love the idea of fusing my love of design with
						my love of technology and education.

						The first I'd like to show is a passion project of mine called Resamplr, which is a web company marketplace for resources
						relating to digital music production.
					</aside>

				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/audio.gif" data-background-size="cover" class="theme-dark compact">

					<h2>Light Background</h2>
					<p>
						Musicians can add real instruments digitally through a process called "sampling". Resamplr is an online marketplace for sampled
						instruments.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is a project I've been working on for over 4 years. I'll lightly touch upon earlier instances but will focus mainly
						on final iterations and process work.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						So, before I get into more detail, here's a little bit of background on what Resamplr is and what technology it uses.
						<br>
						<br> Resamplr is a webstore for sampled instruments.
						<br>Sampling is a process where a real-life instrument are digitized for use in a virtual studio. (For instance, game or
						movie studios often use a purely sampled orchestra instead of an expensive live performance - and hobbyist music producers
						add sampeled instruments to add realism to their tracks.)
						<br>
						<br> Sampled instruments are being used more and more, with flagship audio companies like Native Instruments offering huge
						instrument libraries for thousands of dollars.
						<br>
						<br> As a musician myself, I've created several sampled instruments, and I wanted a way to publish them for others to use.
						<br>
						<br> Just in terms of this presentation's scope, Resamplr has a ton of versions and process work, but today I'll just be
						highlighting more recent iterations and what I've learned.

				<!-- problem, solution -->
				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/headphones-bg.jpg" data-background-position="left" data-background-size="cover"
				 class="compact">

					<div style="max-width: 400px;">
						<h2>The Problem</h2>
						<p>Companies that create digital instruments often implement poor & impersonal user experiences.</p>

						<h2>The Solution</h2>
						<p>Create a modern and approachable audio software company that puts users' needs
							<br> first. Sales follow customer happiness.</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							I identified multiple problems with current solutions relating to both audio companies and web stores in general.
							<br>
							<br> - Audio companies are still very proprietary, closed, and impersonal. Their web presence is usually sterile and very
							corporate - which doesn't really mesh with music culture.
							<br>
							<br> - I also sought to create this site because current solutions weren't specialized enough, and took too much profit.
							One-off marketplace sites like Sellfy didn't allow for much branding work, and took as much as 20%.
							<br>
							<br> ----
							<br>
							<br> - the solution was to create my own approachable audio software marketplace that had a focus on user-centric design.
							<br>
							<br> - Additionally, by creating my own site I could integrate another payment processor and bring fees down to as little
							as 3%.

					<h2>My Responsibilities</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>UI & UX</li>
						<li>Visual Design</li>
						<li>Creative Direction</li>
						<li>Development</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						My responsibilities for this project included UI/UX design, Visual & Creative direction, as well as web development. I really
						wanted to see this project through as I'm very passionate about the topic, so I had to learn quite a few things in
						the process.

				<!-- User Journey -->
				<section>
					<div class="grid">
						<div class="col">
							<h2>User Journey</h2>
							<p>A digital commerce site isn't exactly groundbreaking territory - but it's easy to get things wrong.</p>
							<p>My goal is to create as little friction as possible and encourage the user to purchase items.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col">
							<img src="media/resamplr/user-flow.svg" />
						</div>
					</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						I started by creating a user journey with a simple chart illustrating user navigation.
						<br>
						<br> While a commerce site doesn't seem particularly exciting or groundbreaking, there are a lot of common pitfalls I see
						in other commerce sites.
						<br>
						<br>

				<!-- User Journey - Login -->
				<section>
					<div class="grid">
						<div class="col">
							<h2>User Journey - Login</h2>
							<p>User sign-in pages can be where many potential customers lose interest.</p>
							<p>Let's have as little friction as possible.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col">
							<img src="media/resamplr/login-flow.svg" />
						</div>
					</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						For instance, many sites will require a login before an item can be added to a user cart. Asking a user to login creates
						unnecessary friction that may cause them to leave.
						<br>
						<br> Instead, I designed the site to get users invested before requiring a login or credit card number. Any user - logged
						in or not - can wishlist items. That small time investment will encourage them to go the extra step to create an account
						or enter in payment information later.
						<br>
						<br> On the product side of the user experience, I made sure to promote free resources and sound packs to encourage new
						users to register an account.

				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/rev2player.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Audio samples were especially important, so I created several variations before finding a layout that balanced visual design
						with information.
						<br>
						<br> I planned for the sound player to be persistent through page changes (similar to soundcloud) so the user could browse
						other products while listening to samples from another product.

				<!-- issues and fixes -->

				<section>
					<h2>Issues & Improvements</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						I created this design for Resamplr in 2016. However, I went back and reviewed my design in early 2018 as I learned a lot
						since my first iteration.
						<br>
						<br> This next section will highlight the problems I found with my previous design, and what I did to resolve those issues.

				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/rev2home_noissue.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Taking a look at the homepage, there is a lot that can be improved.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/rev2home_issue.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						The very thin white text on a saturated, bright red background has very poor contrast and readability.
						<br>
						<br> This problem is even more pronounced when light text is over an image.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/rev2home_issue2.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Additionally, while I may have written a summary of what Resamplr *is*, it's better to *show* what services it provides.
						Supporting text is great, but for the most part users skip text and go straight to media and other content!
					</aside>

						- it still has some contrast issues. Also, it doesn't have a forgot password button!
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/rev2product_noissue.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						By far, I learned the most from the product page.

				</section>

				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/rev2product_hierarchy.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						The usage of color here was somewhat inconsistent and led to poor visual hierarchy.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/rev2product_duplicate.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Additionally some controls were also duplicated across the page which could confuse users.

				</section>

				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/rev2product_noissue.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Finally, the visual aesthetic - while clean - lacked the vibrancy and soul of what a music website should display.
					</aside>
				</section>


				<!-- new principles for design -->
				<section>
					<h2>New Iterations</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						In early 2018, I reworked my previous design and focused on fixing the issues I mentioned above.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<!-- new comps -->
				<section>
					<div style="overflow: scroll; max-height: 60vh;">
						<img src="media/resamplr/comps/home.png" style="width: 100%;" />
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						The new homepage shows users what Resamplr provides, instead of telling them with boring text. Products are shown on the
						first page, along with a playable sample, description, and price. The bottom of the page features an area where social
						content could be displayed from tutorials to giveaways.
						<br>
						<br> The top of the page presents a huge banner that shows featured products. I had something similar with my older design,
						except the link redirected to the products page. After looking at clicks using google analytics, I noticed many users
						clicked through but then left. I hoped that linking directly to a product would help user engagment.
						<br>
						<br> In terms of visual style, I used complementary colors as well as angles to make the page more exciting and dynamic
						and I drew inspiration from jazz-era posters and media.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/signup.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						The typography is still modern and thin, but much more legible. A slightly thicker font combined with a dark-on-light theme
						greatly helps visibility.
						<br>
						<br> The login form provides all features users would expect.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<div style="overflow: scroll; max-height: 60vh;">
						<img src="media/resamplr/comps/about.png" style="width: 100%;" />
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						The support page was clearly labeled and answered as many frequent questions as possible. A contact form is at the bottom
						as a last resort to encourage users to take a look at the FAQ first to see if their question has already been answered.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/product.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						On to the product page -
						<br> I believe the biggest improvement was a smarter usage of color. Purple was reserved for interactions and other high-importance
						sections.
						<br>
						<br> The new one-column layout helped cut down on visual noise and better guide the user towards content and media.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/product2.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Additionally, the product header allowed for a customizable background image and logo. This made individual product branding
						possible.

				<!-- Resamplr in action -->
				<section>
					<a href="https://resamplr.com" target="_blank">
						<h2>resamplr.com</h2>
					</a>
					<aside class="notes">
						So Resamplr is actually live right now! I created it in spare time during college using Rails & hosting on a small Ubuntu
						server.
						<br>
						<br> It's still not 100% complete but I think it's a big improvement.

						<div>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment fade-in">Allow user generated content</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-in">Greater emphasis on social & sharing</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-in">Save user payment data for quick checkouts</li>

							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						What's next?
						<br>
						<br> I want to allow user-generated content. Allowing users to upload their own instruments and sell them would help cultivate
						a recurring user base.-
						<br>
						<br> Adding share buttons like "tweet this to get 25% off your order" have proven effective advertising for me in the past.
						I'd like to implement something like that here too.
						<br>
						<br> I want to be able to save user payment data, so that buying new products is as easy as 2 or 3 clicks.
						<br>
						<br>I also want to add more content like music tutorials and blog posts. Only part of Resamplr's brand can be represented
						with visual style; the other parts come from the community itself.
						<br>
						<br> Something I'd like to know more about is effective marketing and advertising. I think it can really help the website
						if done properly.
						<br>
						<br> Finally, I'd like to do real user testing. I've found methods like eye tracking great for checking visual hierarchy
						and I'd like to try something like that.

					<h1>Animate</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						The second project I'd like to show today is a desktop audio application called Animate.
						<br>
						<br> Animate is an audio effect filter, which means it takes input audio from vocals or an instrument and changes it digitally
						(similar to a guitar pedal)
					</aside>

				<!-- problem, solution -->
				<section data-background-image="media/animate/bg.jpg" data-background-position="bottom" data-background-size="cover" class="compact">

					<h2>The Problem</h2>
					<p>There are currently no applications that allow for creative filter design. Those applications are difficult to animate
						or change over time.</p>

					<h2>The Solution</h2>
					<p>Create a flexible and intuitive audio filter automation program by utilizing affordances learned through other programs.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						There's a lot of audio effects on the internet, so why make another? Well, no current solutions allow for the effect to easily
						modulate over time. Additionally, most modern audio effects look like theyre stuck in 2001 with confusing and skeuomorphic
						designs.
						<br>
						<br> My solution was to create an all-in-one filter design plugin with animation tools built in, as well as to create a
						consistent design language for application controls.

						teams such as the Steelers.

						<br> The Reel was created in a very small period of time, so I have a few features I would like to implement in the future.
						<br>
						<br> For example, there should be a small onboarding for teaching users how the content stream worked. Another small tutorial
						might show users how to favorite a video and properly interact with the app since it's partially gesture based.

				<h1>Thank you!</h1>

					That concludes my portfolio presentation. Narrowing this down to just 3 projects was difficult, but I hope I provided some
					insight to my design process.
					<br>
					<br> I do have a few other projects that are works-in-progress with more research-based approaches. For example, I've started
					a project that attempts to fix programming documentation design issues based on user feedback on my portfolio, as well
					as a whole bunch of other stuff I couldn't fit into 30 minutes.
					<br>
					<br> Thank you for the oppurtunity!
