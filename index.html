					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Started computers & design with 3D</li>
						<li>Began degree in New Media Design in 2014</li>
						<li>Fell in love with UI/UX</li>
						<li>Graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology in May 2018</li>
						<li>Now I'm interviewing with Linux Academy (yay!)</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						- I started getting really into digital design around 10-12 when I picked up the 3D platform "Blender" and started messing around with it<br><br>
						- That evolved into a variety of design disciplines ranging from app design concepts to motion graphics / youtube tutorials, and website design<br><br>
						-  In 2014 I started college & new media design, where I focused on UI/UX<br><br>
						- Just graduated in May<br><br>
						- Came across Linux Academy<br><br>

					<h2>More About Me</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Scranton resident</li>
						<li>Games & Music</li>
						<li>Education background</li>
						<li>Love Animals</li>
						<li>Programmer & Linux User</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						- So in terms of who I am as a person,<br><br>
						- I was born and raised in Scranton, PA - a former coal-mining town that you may have heard of if you ever watched The Office<br><br>
						- I pass the time with music and computer games (and I've even tried to create some games)<br><br>
						- Both my parents are public school teachers, grew up in an environment that had a big focus on teaching.<br><br>
						- In college I started picking up programming & development along with Unix systems.   - In fact, later in college I had a part time job teaching basic coding skills to kids at a place called iCanCode Club<br><br>
						-  That's partly why I'm passionate about Linux Academy and their mission.  I love the idea of fusing my love of design with my love of technology and education.<br><br>

					<h2>Light Background</h2>
					<p>
						Musicians can add real instruments digitally through a process called "sampling".  Resamplr is an online marketplace for sampled instruments.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is a project I've been working on for over 4 years.  I'll lightly touch upon earlier instances but will focus mainly on final iterations and process work.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						To give some light background, Resamplr is a marketplace for sampled instruments.  Sampling is a process where a real-life instrument is digitized for easy use in a virtual studio.<br><br>
						In terms of project scope, Resamplr has a ton of versions and process work.  Today I'll just be highlighting more recent iterations and what I've learned from them.

				<!-- problem, solution -->
				<section data-background-image="media/resamplr/headphones-bg.jpg" data-background-position="left" data-background-size="cover" class="compact">

					<div style="max-width: 400px;">
						<h2>The Problem</h2>
						<p>Companies that create digital instruments often implement poor & impersonal user experiences.</p>

						<h2>The Solution</h2>
						<p>Create a modern and approachable audio software company that puts users' needs<br> first.  Sales follow customer happiness.</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							I identified multiple problems with current solutions relating to both audio companies and marketplaces in general.<br><br>
							- Audio companies are still very proprietary, closed, and impersonal.  Their web presence is usually sterile and overly professional for products like music.<br><br>
							- I also sought to create this site because current solutions weren't specialized enough, and took too much profit.  One-off marketplace sites like Sellfy didn't allow for much branding work, and took as much as 20% of profits.<br><br>
							----<br><br>
							- the solution was to create my own approachable audio software marketplace that had a focus on user-centric design.<br><br>
							- Additionally, by creating my own site I could integrate another payment processor and bring fees down to as little as 3%.<br><br>

					<h2>My Responsibilities</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>UI & UX</li>
						<li>Visual Design</li>
						<li>Creative Direction</li>
						<li>Development</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						My responsibilities for this project included UI/UX design, Visual & Creative direction, as well as web development.  I really wanted to see this project through, so I had to learn quite a few things in the process.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<!-- User Journey -->
				<section>
					<div class="grid">
						<div class="col">
							<h2>User Journey</h2>
							<p>A digital commerce site isn't exactly groundbreaking territory - but it's easy to get things wrong.</p>
							<p>My goal is to create as little friction as possible and encourage the user to purchase items.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col">
							<img src="media/resamplr/user-flow.svg"/>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						I started by creating a user journey. I created a simple chart illustrating user navigation.<br><br>
						I highlighted information, sound samples, videos, and imagery since visuals are much more impactful than text.  While a commerce site doesn't seem particularly exciting, there are a lot of common pitfalls I see in other music sites.  <br><br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<!-- User Journey - Login -->
				<section>
					<div class="grid">
						<div class="col">
							<h2>User Journey - Login</h2>
							<p>User sign-in pages can be where many potential customers lose interest.</p><p>Let's have as little friction as possible.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col">
							<img src="media/resamplr/login-flow.svg"/>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						For instance, many sites will require a login before an item can be added to a user cart.  Asking a user to login creates unnecessary friction that may cause them to leave. <br><br>
						Instead, I designed the site to get users invested before springing a login or credit card request.  Any user - logged in or not - can wishlist items.  That investment will later on hopefully encourage them to go the extra step to create an account or enter in payment information.
						<br><br>
						On the product side of the user experience, I made sure to list free resources and sound packs to encourage new users to register an account before even thinking about putting in credit card information.

						After planning out the user journey, I created some quick lofi wireframes to visualize the website flow.  <br><br>
						I'll go into greater detail about my process later in the presentation.

						The title page was meant to introduce new users to what Resamplr is and what it provides.  The extra image cue helps establish the brand as an audio comany.

					data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Audio samples were especially important, so I created several variations before finding a layout that balanced visual design with just enough information.  <br><br>
						I planned for the sound player to be persistent through page changes (similar to soundcloud) so the user could browse other products while listening to samples from another.
					</aside>

				<section 
					data-background-image="media/resamplr/comps/rev2product.png"

						The product page shows all relevant information in a summary to the top right; the name, price, and file formats provided were clearly labeled.  The middle column provided a more free-form layout.

				<!-- issues and fixes -->

				<section>
					<h2>Issues & Improvements</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						I created Resamplr in 2016 after learning some Rails & frontend code.  However, I went back and reviewed my design in early 2018 as I learned a lot since my first iteration.<br><br>
						This next section will highlight the problems I found with my previous design, and what I did to resolve those issues.

				<!-- new principles for design -->
				<section>
					<h2>New Guiding Principles</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Be Personal. </li>
						<li>Be Friendly. </li>
						<li>Be Modern.   </li>
						<li>Be Dynamic.  </li>
					</ol>

					<aside class="notes">
							Be Personal. Don't be corporate. Consumer should feel as though they always come first.
							<br><br>
							Be Friendly. Don't over-complicate interactions. Rewarding users with unique interactions is great, but it shouldn't be overdone.
							<br><br>
							Be Modern. Don't overuse imagery, borders, or other elements that can contribute to visual noise. This isn't a photography website, so make sure that images all contribute to the audio product being sold.
							<br><br>
							Be Dynamic. After all, we're artists.<br><br>
							The main objective is to provide a different and better experience for all users - an experience that is easier, more intuitive, cleaner, and more developer-friendly than competitors.
